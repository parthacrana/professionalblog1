personal blog 
This is the readme file for the personal blog challenge! Week 2 challenge 4! 

This repo contains both the html, css and the javascript files for the personal blog website!

Feel free to explore any or all of these files! 

There are many things that I did not know in this week's challenge. Few of them mainly being javascript, toggling darkmode, and local storage.
